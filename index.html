      <p>
        It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the
        Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
        Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is
        layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
        rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
        results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
